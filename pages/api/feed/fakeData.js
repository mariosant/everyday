The main reason I began cooking Thai food at home was to try to get more authentic flavors than what local restaurants serve up, and having familiarized myself with a lot of those special ingredients, these <strong>Thai red curry wings</strong> take full advantage of that knowledge and make no compromise or substitutions on what's more traditional. That may make the final recipe a little daunting to some, but you have to trust me, seeking out and learning about these flavors and ingredients pays off immensely in the end.<br><br><a href=\"https://meatwave.com/blog/thai-red-curry-chicken-wings-recipe\">Read more and get recipe >></a>",

      "content": "<p>Oysters on the grill and smoker have been something I tried early on in my grilling career. Most people were like- You can grill oysters? Well yes you can! And you can smoke them too!</p>\n<p>This recipe is from my cookbook, Healthy Electric Smoker, but you can smoke oysters on any grill or smoker as long as you know how to create smoke! (Ie, direct versus indirect zones!). If you want to learn all about how to do this, check out my grill school video where I teach grilling basics, including how to set up zones on your grill for direct grilling or indirect for smoking. And of course if you have a Pellet smoker or Electric smoker then all you really have to do is push the button to 250 and it will do the rest!</p>\n<p>In this recipe, Oysters serve as a vehicle for a briny, smoky salty mix of kale, bacon and parmesan in this recipe. They cook pretty quickly and are great appetizer for a larger seafood meal or a surf and turf dinner. Double up on quantity and pair with grilled bread and a big salad to turn them into the main course. Skip the bread if you‚Äôre eating low carb or even put them on a parmesan crisp if you need a vehicle for the oyster. But trust me, they‚Äôre good one their own!</p>\n<a href=\"https://grillgirl.com/2020/01/garlic-bacon-kale-oysters/print/493306/\">Print</a><div>\n\n<header>\n<div>\n<img data-pin-nopin=\"true\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"https://grillgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LRG_DSC02-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://grillgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LRG_DSC02-150x150.jpg 150w, https://grillgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LRG_DSC02-440x440.jpg 440w, https://grillgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LRG_DSC02-100x100.jpg 100w, https://grillgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LRG_DSC02-225x225.jpg 225w\" height=\"150\">\t</div>\n<h2>Garlic Bacon Kale Oysters</h2>\n<hr>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><span>\nAuthor:</span> <span>Robyn</span>\t</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</header>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://grillgirl.com/2020/01/garlic-bacon-kale-oysters/print/493306/\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-pin-nopin=\"true\" src=\"https://grillgirl.com/wp-content/plugins/tasty-recipes/templates/designs/bold/images/icon-print.png\">Print Recipe</a></div>\t<div>\n<a data-pin-custom=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgrillgirl.com%2F2020%2F01%2Fgarlic-bacon-kale-oysters%2F\"><img data-pin-nopin=\"true\" src=\"https://grillgirl.com/wp-content/plugins/tasty-recipes/templates/designs/bold/images/icon-pinterest.png\">Pin Recipe</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Serves 4</p>\n<p>Serving Size One Dozen Oysters</p>\n<p>Prep Time 30 minutes</p>\n<p>Cook Time 30 minutes</p>\n<p>Smoking Wood Alder</p>\n<p>Smoker Temp 250</p>\n<p>Rest Time none</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-amount=\"1\">1</span> dozen fresh oysters</li>\n<li><span data-unit=\"tbsp\" data-amount=\"3\">3 tbsp</span> bacon- approximately 2 pieces of bacon, cooked ¬æ of the way through, fatty parts removed</li>\n<li><span data-unit=\"cup\" data-amount=\"0.5\">¬Ω cup</span> Kale leaves, finely chopped</li>\n<li><span data-unit=\"tbsp\" data-amount=\"2\">2 tbsp</span> shredded parmesan</li>\n<li><span data-amount=\"2\">2</span> cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>\n<li><span data-unit=\"tbsp\" data-amount=\"1\">1 tbsp</span> butter, melted</li>\n<li><span data-unit=\"tsp\" data-amount=\"1\">1 tsp</span> fresh ground pepper</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>With an oyster knife, open the oysters and remove the top leaving the oyster on the bottom half for layering the other ingredients.</li>\n<li>Combine all other ingredients and spoon over each oyster.</li>\n<li>Use a frog mat underneath the oysters so they don‚Äôt fall through the grates and let them smoke for 20 minutes or until the cheese has begun to slightly melt.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<h3>Tips</h3>\n<p>Invest in a good oyster shucking knife and cut resistant gloves to ensure a safe oyster shucking experience</p>\n<h3>Pairing Suggestions/Maximizing Leftovers</h3>\n<p>Pairs wonderfully with grilled bread that can be used for sopping up extra sauce</p>\n</div>\n<footer>\n<div>\n<img data-pin-nopin=\"true\" src=\"https://grillgirl.com/wp-content/plugins/tasty-recipes/templates/designs/bold/images/icon-instagram.png\">\n<h3>Did you make this recipe?</h3>\n<p>Tag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/grillgirlrobyn\" target=\"_blank\">@grillgirlrobyn</a> on Instagram\tand hashtag it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/grillgirlrobyn\" target=\"_blank\">#grillgirlrobyn</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"29vnfrNpeM\"><p><a href=\"https://grillgirl.com/2012/04/herbed-tahini-dressing/\">Herbed Tahini Dressing</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe data-secret=\"29vnfrNpeM\" src=\"https://grillgirl.com/2012/04/herbed-tahini-dressing/embed/#?secret=29vnfrNpeM\" title=\"‚ÄúHerbed Tahini Dressing‚Äù ‚Äî GrillGirl\" width=\"600\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" height=\"338\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"orLmNDUwYb\"><p><a href=\"https://grillgirl.com/2016/07/caribbean-mango-slaw/\">Caribbean Mango Slaw</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe data-secret=\"orLmNDUwYb\" src=\"https://grillgirl.com/2016/07/caribbean-mango-slaw/embed/#?secret=orLmNDUwYb\" title=\"‚ÄúCaribbean Mango Slaw‚Äù ‚Äî GrillGirl\" width=\"600\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" height=\"338\"></iframe></p>\n<span></span><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://grillgirl.com/2020/01/garlic-bacon-kale-oysters/\">Smoked Garlic Bacon Kale Oysters</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://grillgirl.com\">GrillGirl</a>.</p>",

I am the consulting chef for both Anse Chastanet Resort and Jade Mountain. Cooking local, seasonal, and sustainable is my culinary mantra.</p>\n<p>Luckily for us, the surrounding seaside inlets are small, quiet, and colorful fishing villages. A few years back, Peter, one of the local divers, brought in a handful of lionfish with his morning‚Äôs catch of lobsters. We purchase all our fish from the local fisherman and usually get our lobster from the divers. This diver was complaining about how these little monsters were eating everything on the reef and destroying the lobster grounds. Would we buy lionfish from him, too?</p>\n<p>I had heard of lionfish and was even aware that they were rapidly spreading throughout the Caribbean. I understood the problems they were causing and, at the same time was very curious to taste this little creature. And here they were, six of them dangling in front of me, dripping with seawater. My chef‚Äôs inquisitiveness had gotten the better of me: love at first bite. Lionfish have a firm, sweet, white flesh with a slightly briny essence. I was encouraged and enthusiastic. The experience stoked my quest for more delicious tasting local seasonal sustainable ingredients. And that quest has evolved into my newest cookbook, <a href=\"https://barbecuebible.com/book/green-fig-and-lionfish/\"><em>Green Fig &amp; Lionfish: Sustainable Caribbean Cooking</em></a> (Books and Books Press, 2019).</p>\n<p>The story of the lionfish, like all good fish tales, is growing greater each day. These flamboyantly colorful fish with their diverse markings were originally bred in the Indian Ocean. But legend has it that they found their way over to us in the Caribbean when Hurricane Andrew liberated a handful of them from the aquariums of drug lords living in Florida.</p>\n<p>Since then, lionfish have bred prolifically in a ceaseless invasion of our seas from Florida to the West Indies. They thrive in the warm waters of the Atlantic and Caribbean and wreak havoc on our ocean ecosystems and fisheries, gobbling up reef fish, juvenile snapper, and grouper. With no known predators to stop them, the lionfish are more threatening than they are beautiful. Not only are they dangerous to fragile ecosystems, they can also inflict an extremely painful sting on humans. Therefore, we need to jump in and put these delicious fish on our dinner plates.</p>\n<div></div><a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Not+only+are+they+dangerous+to+fragile+ecosystems%2C+lionfish+can+also+inflict+an+extremely+painful+sting+on+humans.+Therefore%2C+we+need+to+jump+in+and+put+these+delicious+fish+on+our+dinner+plates.&via=sraichlen&url=https://barbecuebible.com/2020/01/07/grill-caribbean-lionfish/\" data-link=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Not+only+are+they+dangerous+to+fragile+ecosystems%2C+lionfish+can+also+inflict+an+extremely+painful+sting+on+humans.+Therefore%2C+we+need+to+jump+in+and+put+these+delicious+fish+on+our+dinner+plates.&amp;via=sraichlen&amp;url=https://barbecuebible.com/2020/01/07/grill-caribbean-lionfish/\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>Not only are they dangerous to fragile ecosystems, lionfish can also inflict an extremely painful sting on humans.

Some of these reefs date back over fifty million years. Many of the small reef fish feed on the plants and tiny creatures that make up the reef. In the natural course of the food chain, little fish are nourishment for bigger fish. Larger fish become prey for larger sea creatures, and so on, up to the apex predators of the deep.</p>\n<p>Not only are the reefs at risk due to overfishing, pollution, and climate change, but lionfish are devastating many of the reefs in the Caribbean. They are eating many times their fair share of the nourishment present in the habitat. They have no predators in these waters as they are an invasive species.</p>\n<p>Fish is a backbone of Caribbean life. So much nourishment comes from the sea that surrounds these islands. Though I am talking lionfish grilling, I encourage you to be flexible and feel free to substitute any sustainable seafood such as snapper, grouper, mahi-mahi, or kingfish in place of lionfish. The key to selecting delicious, top quality fish is using your nose. Fresh fish has a clean aroma, a little like the ocean or a salty breeze from a tropical beach.</p>\n<p>Starting off with fresh, pristine fish is essential. Have the fishmonger skin the lionfish and remove all the venomous spines so you do not need to worry about any of this. Give your fish a good rinse under cold running water before you cook it. Many home cooks in the Caribbean often add a squeeze of fresh lime juice at this point too.</p>\n<p>Charcoal and wood fire grilling will impart maximum flavor. Build a good fire and let it burn down to hot white ash embers. Clean and oil the grates and liberally brush the fish with coconut oil, olive oil, or butter. When you put the fish on the grill, do not move it around. After a few minutes, just flip it once and, in another minute or two, off it goes, keeping the flesh moist.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<h2>Recipes from <em>Green Fig and Lionfish</em> by Allen Susser</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://barbecuebible.com/recipe/banana-leaf-grilled-lionfish/\">Banana Leaf Grilled Lionfish</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://barbecuebible.com/recipe/banana-leaf-grilled-lionfish/\"><img sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/banana-leaf-grilled-lionfish-300x450.jpg\" alt=\"Banana Leaf Grilled Lionfish\" width=\"300\" srcset=\"https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/banana-leaf-grilled-lionfish-300x450.jpg 300w, https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/banana-leaf-grilled-lionfish-167x250.jpg 167w, https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/banana-leaf-grilled-lionfish-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/banana-leaf-grilled-lionfish-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/banana-leaf-grilled-lionfish.jpg 853w\" class=\"wp-image-21380\" height=\"450\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://barbecuebible.com/recipe/banana-leaf-grilled-lionfish/\">Get the Recipe ¬ª</a></p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://barbecuebible.com/recipe/bbq-lionfish-with-orange-and-almond-slaw/\">BBQ Lionfish with Orange &amp; Almond Slaw</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://barbecuebible.com/recipe/bbq-lionfish-with-orange-and-almond-slaw/\"><img sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/featured-bbq-lionfish-with-orange-almond-slaw-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"BBQ Lionfish with Orange Almond Slaw\" width=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/featured-bbq-lionfish-with-orange-almond-slaw-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/featured-bbq-lionfish-with-orange-almond-slaw-250x156.jpg 250w, https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/featured-bbq-lionfish-with-orange-almond-slaw-450x281.jpg 450w, https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/featured-bbq-lionfish-with-orange-almond-slaw-768x480.jpg 768w, https://barbecuebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/featured-bbq-lionfish-with-orange-almond-slaw.jpg 1200w\" class=\"wp-image-21382\" height=\"640\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://barbecuebible.com/recipe/bbq-lionfish-with-orange-and-almond-slaw/\">Get the Recipe ¬ª</a></p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p>Chef Allen Susser is a James Beard Award winning Chef.

      "content": "The Olive Burger was made famous by Mr. Fables in Grand Rapids Michigan. Unfortunately, Mr. Fables closed their doors in 2000. I found this recipe a couple years ago online and the reviews say that is is spot on. So, Michigan I give you the first Mr. Fables Olive Burger Video on the web! Enjoy!\nBuy Ballistic Mojoe Griddle here: https://www.mojoegriddle.com/shop/ballistic-mojoe 80/20 Shirts here: https://teespring.com/stores/ballistic-bbq-2\nMr. Fables Recipe Link: https://www.recipesecrets.net/forums/your-favorite-recipes/26790-mr-fables-olive-burgers-onion-rings.html\nMr. Fables Double Olive Burger with cheese\nmakes 2 burgers\n---------------------------\n1 lb 81/19 ground chuck\n3 tbsp chopped green salad olives with pimento (about ten whole olives)\n2 tbsp Helman's Mayonnaise (Best Foods on the West Coast)\n2 tsp olive juice\n2 pieces iceberg lettuce (not the white part; must be green, and not the very-outer green part)\n2 slices of tomato, large enough for one to cover the bottom bun\n2 slices Kraft American cheese\n2 white buns\nHeat griddle or frying pan to 350 degrees. Mix the olive juice with the mayo. Split the chuck into 4-4oz VERY FLAT patties and cook them on a flattop or griddle. They were not charbroiled... Place a slice of cheese on two patties and top with the other patties, like you would two double cheeseburgers. Place buns in the microwave for ten seconds to warm (do not toast or grill the buns). Stack each bottom bun with one slice of the lettuce leaf, one tomato, a tbsp of the mayo, and a tbsp of the chopped olives. Place burgers on top of the condiments, top with the top bun, and enjoy!\n--------------------------\n3 large yellow onions, peeled\n5 1/2 cups Drakes Crispy Frymix\n1/2 tbsp paprika\n1 qt water\nDeep fryer or pan with foodservice frying oil (can be found at any foodservice warehouse or provider)\nHeat deep fryer or pan with oil to 350 degrees. Slice onion into 1/4 to 1/2 inch rings, removing the centers. The rings should be at least 2 inches in diameter. Mix paprika into Drakes mix and add water. Mix well. Dip onion rings into batter and add to fryer one at a time, making sure that the rings are completely covered. The handle of a teaspoon works well for this purpose. Fry rings until golden brown.\n#BallisticBBQ #MrFables #MojoeOutfitters",
